Steps on How to Create GitHub Page:
1. Accept given assignment (repository)
2. Clone given repository into own machine and modify the files to your liking
3. Once done, change visibility of the repository into public and choose which branch will be used to host the website then save

Key Takeaways:
- Creating a webpage using HTML and CSS is a lot of tedious work and is very detail-oriented and if I continued to do so, I think it would greatly help me develop my skills in programming in general as this style of coding requires me to be aware of various different tags and styles that must be combined together to get the desired result. Overall I've enjoyed this activity and would like to learn more about web development.
